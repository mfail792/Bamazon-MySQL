# Bamazon-MySQL

This application allows the end user to view a 'market' that contains various products available for purchase.  The app uses MySQL to store a database.  The user is able to call the market upon request using a command prompt and 'node bamazonCustomer.js'.  From here, the user is able to view all of the products and input a selection, along with a quantity.  If the market has enough product in stock, the user will be provided a message that lets them know the purchase was a success.  If the quantity the user wants exceeds the inventory level, the user will be alerted.

This application uses MySQL for database information, node.js to execute the logic and three different npm packages (MySQL, Inquirer and CLI-Table2).
